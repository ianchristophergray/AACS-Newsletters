                  <span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; color: #ffffff;">The financial review for the 2023-2024 school year illustrated a strong financial picture, with revenues from Alberta Education surpassing $11 million. This revenue aligned with our projected budget. We continue to monitor expenses closely to ensure responsible financial stewardship, and welcome all members (every parent of an AACS child is considered a member) to join our Audit &amp; Finance Committee, chaired by Constance Amenaghawon.</span>

We are excited to see the progress in these areas and are confident that these changes will enhance the learning experience for our high school students.</span></p>
